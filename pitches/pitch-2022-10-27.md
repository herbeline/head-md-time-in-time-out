#Slowing down and accelerating time with animals
- 2022-10-27:15:00

I started by observing how animals behave and organize their time compared to humans, including when don't do anything at all. I also did some studies regarding how they perceive time: I learnt that generally the smaller an animal is, and the faster its metabolic rate, the slower time passes, which explains why flies are so good at dodging our movements. 
Therefore, I could build my story on how this different space-time impacts cohabitation between species. I like the concept of different animals waiting for the same thing, a synchronized event happening in a moment of the day, but each of them feel the waiting time differently.
