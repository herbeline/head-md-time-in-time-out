# Countdown to life

- You have/are a larva 
- You have to wait until the countdown comes to 00:00 or 100% so your pet larva/you can finally go out of your cocoon and live

Almost every insect goes through a phase of larva, whether it's short or very long. It's often in total darkness, lonely in a cocoon, like a butterfly or a cicada. However, it's not like a foetal state where they're not "alive" yet: they are alive, but waiting for the right moment to go outside, travel, mate and die. How do they perceive that waiting time ? How do they prepare to the only one and most important moment in their life ?
