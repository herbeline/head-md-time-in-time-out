# Countdown to life

Almost every insect goes through a phase of larva, whether it's short or very long. It's often in a total darkness, lonely in a cocoon, like a butterfly or a cicada. However, it's not like a foetal state where they're not "alive" yet, they are alive, but waiting for the right moment to go outside, travel, mate and die. How do they perceive that time ?
