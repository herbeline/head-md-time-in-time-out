# a matter of scale & perspective

"primitive" animal's objectives are just surviving. therefore time is just a tool 

### Bees
- organization of their time on different scales (hour,day,year), very few pauses and idle time

### Cicadas
- 17 years underground, few days outside

### Butterflies
- some of them live 1 or 2 days because they were born without a mouth



## Poem about time
perception of butterfly building his world around the tree. the notion of "eternity" is important, in the scale of the butterfly the tree never moved and will never do so, because of how slow it grows. Nostos

## Relationship with humans
how could a human be inspired by this?
