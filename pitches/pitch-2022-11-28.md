# Countdown to life

## Idea 1 

- You have a pet larva 
- You have to wait until the countdown comes to 00:00 or 100% so your pet larva can finally go out of its cocoon and live its life

## Idea 2 

- The wearable is something that connects you to a real animal and gives you informations about its day (a bit like parrainage d'une tortue and keeping a track of its trajectory)

## Idea 3

- Scale a fly's day to your scale as a human
