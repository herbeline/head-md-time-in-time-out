# Accumulateur

1. You posess a synthesizer, a tool you can use to collect different data in real life to mix together, like some kind of petri dish. 
2. Once you think your "recipe" is done, you incubate it. The point of this is you've just "fed" a virtual embryo, to give birth to a living organism. 
3. What spawns from your mix is a creature whose visual features depends on your lifestyle and the data you gathered during its time around you. 
4. You can put this creature alongside with the others you might have created before, in a virtual aquarium, on any platform, so you can come back and see them grow eventually.

## Different features depending on the inputs:

Time (how much time you wait until you decide your egg is ready) -> Visual complexity of the cell
Movement (how much you've moved with your egg) -> How quick and dynamic the organism will be
Temperature (the temperature in which you've stayed the most) -> Will influence the colour of the organism
Proximity (if other people carry their synthetizer with them and you spend time nearby) -> Social instinct in the aquarium
Humidity (how much have you been exposed to water) -> Sharpness of the shape
Electromagnetism (how much have you been exposed to electricity) -> Will define how agitated your organism will be
