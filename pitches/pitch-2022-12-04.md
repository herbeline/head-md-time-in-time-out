# Virtual Aquarium

You are a vehicle between real and virtual worlds. You have the power to feed virtual creatures with real world's informations. How will those creatures look like, and behave, depending on what you've fed them ? 

1. You possess a synthesizer, a tool you can use to collect different data in real life to mix together, like some kind of petri dish. 
2. Once you think your "recipe" is done, you incubate it. The point of this is you've just "fed" a virtual embryo, to give birth to a living organism. 
3. What spawns from your mix is a creature whose visual features depends on your lifestyle and the data you gathered during its time around you. 
4. You can put this creature alongside with the others you might have created before, in a virtual aquarium, on any platform, so you can come back and see them grow eventually.

## Different features depending on the inputs:

- Time (how much time you wait until you decide your egg is ready) -> Visual complexity of the cell
- Movement (how much you've moved with your egg) -> How quick and dynamic the organism will be
- Temperature (the temperature in which you've stayed the most) -> Will influence the colour of the organism
- Proximity (if other people carry their synthetizer with them and you spend time nearby) -> Social instinct in the aquarium
- Humidity (how much have you been exposed to water) -> Sharpness of the shape
- Electromagnetism (how much have you been exposed to electricity) -> Will define how agitated your organism will be
- GPS signal (where you live in the globe) -> Depending on which area you live, maybe it's initial shape will be different. You could trade with other people around the globe to have new shapes
- Heartbeat -> If you're stressed, your creature will be stressed


Depending on what your aquarium looks like, you can vizualise what your lifestyle is like: is it healthy ? Have you had a period of time where you moved a lot ? Have you met enough people, or have you stayed by yourself a lot ? Remember that night you stayed in the cold for 2 hours, waiting for the club to open ? Each creature belongs to a moment and defines a memory, so your aquarium is a visual way to keep track of your life and to remember key instants.
