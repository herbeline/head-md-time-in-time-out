Updates on the shape of the "egg": 
- must kinda look like a chrysalis
- mixing visually tech & bio
- should think of what's inside: is it a plant? an animal? a micro-organism? a fungus? all of these at once?

Updates on the name of the project:
- Virtual Vivarium
- Numeric Garden
- Electronic Aquarium
