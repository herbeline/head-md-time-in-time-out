## How do you feel about the amount of time you’ve got in a day ?
- Not enough, but when I do have time, I can’t decide what to do so I just lay on bed watching Vtubers lol
- It’s like time slips btw my hands and I get anxious of not being able to do everything in a single day; and this anxiety pushes me to do nothing and stare at my phone all day, making the day really long
- I would say it is enough but I stay up late at night and I leave my job early
- Weirdly I feel I don’t have enough time for everything I want yet I passe a lot of time on social media
- I’m trying to slow it down
- Enough time when you wake up at 5 in the morning
- There’s never enough time to get everything done
- Never enough time, seems like I can only work and sleep, would love to get longer days. I’m sometimes trying to just wait to be bored a little to empty my mind and make the time go slower.
- I’m trying to make it through the day as quick as possible but then regret I did not put my time for better use
- Days are too short. We don’t have the time to sleep, to do chores and everything
- There’s not enough time so I stay up late to feel like I have more free time
- Enough. I try to organize my days as best as I can and schedule my week depending on what I want to do
- Definitely too much time, really bored
- Too much time, so I lose the value of my time and I never do anything productive
- Not enough time in the day. I have an ever-growing to-do list of things I want to do
- Gotta skip time every once and again but good overall
- Depends really on my mood, somedays I’ll actually do something productive whereas other days I spend mostly asleep or feeling like shit
- I feel like I miss 2-3 hrs a day to lead a normal life.
- It’s a fucking nightmare how fast it goes by, I can’t
- It’s okay but sleeping is a waste of time
- Not enough because I’m not spending it properly
- Not enough most of the time - too exhausted after work to get anything more done than scrolling instagram, and too much scrolling to get anything else done - I should delete this app…
- I’m OK with the time I’ve got !
- 24h a day, 12h awake minimum, seems great to me
- Too much time, trying to get more things done in a day but it’s hard when you can’t stop procrastinating

## How do animals perceive time ?

### Laziness in animals & notion of "doing nothing"
*"The question of why these beasts are often idle is investigated by examining their foraging behavior in a model which does not utilize optimization criteria. If an organism's goal is to stay alive, one satisfactory strategy is a thermostat feeding process whereby the animal initiates foraging when it perceives hunger and ceases when it becomes satiated."*

*"All cold-blooded animals spend an unexpectedly large pro-portion of their time doing nothing at all, or at any rate,nothing in particular."* C.Elton

*"most mammals become bored when they stop learning about their environment or stop having new experiences. Scientists theorise that they evolved this way to be prompted to explore and find more suitable habitats or richer food sources."*

*"Tarantulas, as well as other insects, do not become bored. This is because they don’t have the brain complexity to feel the need to explore and seek new knowledge. When a tarantula isn’t moving, it is simply content with having no threats to its survival."*
