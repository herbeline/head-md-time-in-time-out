## How do you feel about the amount of time you’ve got in a day ?
- Not enough, but when I do have time, I can’t decide what to do so I just lay on bed watching Vtubers lol
- It’s like time slips btw my hands and I get anxious of not being able to do everything in a single day; and this anxiety pushes me to do nothing and stare at my phone all day, making the day really long
- I would say it is enough but I stay up late at night and I leave my job early
- Weirdly I feel I don’t have enough time for everything I want yet I passe a lot of time on social media
- I’m trying to slow it down
- Enough time when you wake up at 5 in the morning
- There’s never enough time to get everything done
- Never enough time, seems like I can only work and sleep, would love to get longer days. I’m sometimes trying to just wait to be bored a little to empty my mind and make the time go slower.
- I’m trying to make it through the day as quick as possible but then regret I did not put my time for better use
- Days are too short. We don’t have the time to sleep, to do chores and everything
- There’s not enough time so I stay up late to feel like I have more free time
- Enough. I try to organize my days as best as I can and schedule my week depending on what I want to do
- Definitely too much time, really bored
- Too much time, so I lose the value of my time and I never do anything productive
- Not enough time in the day. I have an ever-growing to-do list of things I want to do
- Gotta skip time every once and again but good overall
- Depends really on my mood, somedays I’ll actually do something productive whereas other days I spend mostly asleep or feeling like shit
- I feel like I miss 2-3 hrs a day to lead a normal life.
- It’s a fucking nightmare how fast it goes by, I can’t
- It’s okay but sleeping is a waste of time
- Not enough because I’m not spending it properly
- Not enough most of the time - too exhausted after work to get anything more done than scrolling instagram, and too much scrolling to get anything else done - I should delete this app…
- I’m OK with the time I’ve got !
- 24h a day, 12h awake minimum, seems great to me
- Too much time, trying to get more things done in a day but it’s hard when you can’t stop procrastinating

## How do animals perceive time ?
### Different space-time than humans
Small animals perceive time in slow motion

### Laziness in animals & notion of "doing nothing"
*"The question of why these beasts are often idle is investigated by examining their foraging behavior in a model which does not utilize optimization criteria. If an organism's goal is to stay alive, one satisfactory strategy is a thermostat feeding process whereby the animal initiates foraging when it perceives hunger and ceases when it becomes satiated."*
